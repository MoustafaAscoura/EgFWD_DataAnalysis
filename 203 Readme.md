# Flight Crashes Over The Last Century
### by Moustafa Ibrahim Ascoura


## Dataset

The data set used in this project is present here https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/airplane-crashes-data-visualization. It is a record of over 5000 flight crashes from 1908 to 2008. For every entry, it shows the aircraft description and the location and time of the accident, it also provides the number of passengers aboard, number of victims and number of survivors.


## Summary of Findings

Our first investigation was about the timeline of accidents. We found that the number of accidents per year have been increasing, this was explained by the fact that the number of flights, or airplanes, has increased substantially. The second question was which aircraft type has crashed the most, this was found to be Douglas DC-3, which is the most popular commercial aircraft in the last century. When we looked further into DC-3 stats, we got some interesting findings: Only a few accidents of this aircraft caused high fatalitites, and most of them occured at an early stage of air transport. We also looked at the average deaths per accidents, and this also was less than 20 victims per accidents on average.

The number of fatalities per year synced with the number of accidents per year. And we found that most fatalities were in the atlantic ocean in the Canary Islands and near Japan. The most interesting plot was that of the distribution of fatalities and survivors over the different times of the day. Most survivors were saved in the daylight hours (from 07:00 to 13:00).

We also saw how some airplanes have the highest numbers of accidents and most recent ones such as Douglas C-47, YAK-40, DHC-6, and AN-26. These all are mostly cargo planes as the deaths are not high. Some aircrafts crash more frequently than others in different periods of time. That gives us a overview of when and how these manufacturers are developing themselves and how these bad eperiences help improve the safety of the flights. Also, the operators of these aircrafts seemed to use them in a different way which resulted in variation of victim numbers over the years.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, we'll be looking at Timeline of the Accidents in the Dataset, What Aircraft Type Had the Most Accidents, and the distribution of fatalities and survivors over the different times of the day, and airplanes with the highest numbers of accidents.
